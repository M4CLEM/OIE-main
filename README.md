Project Description:

This project is a comprehensive OJT/Internship Program Management System designed to support and streamline the internship processes required as part of the college curriculum. It serves as a centralized platform for students, advisers, and company representatives to effectively coordinate all aspects of the On-the-Job Training (OJT) program.

Key features of the system include:

- Job Postings Portal: Allows companies to post internship opportunities, and students to browse and apply for positions that match their qualifications and interests.

- Cloud-Based File Management System: Enables students to upload required documents such as resumes, acceptance letters, daily logs, and reports, while allowing advisers and coordinators to review and manage submissions remotely.

- OJT Clearance and Compliance Monitoring: Tracks the progress of students’ OJT requirements, including hours rendered, document submissions, and clearance status to ensure timely compliance.

- Integrated Grading System: Facilitates the evaluation of students' performance through adviser and company assessments, automatically computing final grades based on predefined rubrics.

- Academic Date System: Used for managing important academic schedules such as internship start and end dates, deadlines for document submissions, evaluation periods, and other critical timeframes throughout the OJT process.

The system aims to improve efficiency, transparency, and communication among all parties involved in the internship program while reducing paperwork and administrative overhead.
